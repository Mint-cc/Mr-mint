This project satisfies the requirements of the HNG Internship Project with a straightforward Flask-based API. It generates a JSON-formatted endpoint that accepts two GET request query parameters, processes the input, and delivers particular data. Included in the data are the Slack name, weekday, UTC time, track, GitHub file URL, and GitHub repository URL.
